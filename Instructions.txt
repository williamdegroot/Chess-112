Welcome to Chess.

In this game, the White team always move first.
Take your turn by clicking on your team's piece that you want to move.
     This piece will become highlighted.
     Then, click the square you want to move that piece to.
If you wish to move a different piece than originally selected,
     click on a different square that is also occupied by your own piece,
     and that square will become highlighted.
If you attempt an invalid move, your piece will not move,
     and the original piece clicked will remain highlighted for you to try again.
You cannot complete a move that puts or leaves your King in check.

Promoting:
     If a pawn reaches the other end of the board, it can be promoted using specific keys.
     You must press the key immediately after moving to the end of the board. 
          Press 'b' to promote to Bishop, 'k' to promote to Knight, 
          'r' to promote to Rook, or press 'q' to promote to Queen.

Castling:
     In order to castle, the King and the Rook must not have been moved yet.
     The spaces in-between the King and the Rook must be empty 
          and unthreatened by the opposing team. 
     Additionally, the King must not be in check. 
          Press 'd' to castle on the King-side or press 'a' to castle on the Queen-side.
     The pieces will jump and your turn will be over.
	
If a team gets checkmate, the winner will be announced and the game will end.
If there is a stalemate, no team wins. The game will end.

Press ok to play and enjoy!
